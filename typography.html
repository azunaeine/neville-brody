                        Brody is notably known for creating his own typography. His most famous typography is
                        called the new wave style. This style of typography openly resists strict grid-based arrangements.
                        This makes the design look more unique and meaningful. The spacing and layout of the letters
                        make the design look irregular, showcasing some presence of a punk era. The text intrigued the
                        younger generations, which was the target market for the Face magazine. His new wave style
                        typography is widely known today and has influenced many typographers.

                        Brody used bold and irregular layouts for his designs and typography. Brody is also
                        known for working in “mixed media”. Mixed media is defined as a way for someone to use
                        different techniques and styles in a single design, by blending handmade ways with the
                        utilization of computers. His approach to design has been widely used by designers today. There
                        are many designers and typographers who have utilized his styles and techniques in their
                        designs. Nowadays, designers are unafraid to utilize bold and unusual layouts in their designs or
                        typography. Brody has influenced typography because many designers are stealing his
                        techniques and incorporating them into their typography. Moreover, Brody created other fonts
                        such as “insignia”. His creation of fonts has inspired other typographers to create their own fonts.
                        Brody created a pathway for designers to be bold and ambitious when designing and to make
                        new discoveries in design. Such as creating a new font.
